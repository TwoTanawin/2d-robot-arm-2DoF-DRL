# 2d-robot-arm-2DoF-DRL

This project aims to develop a pick-and-place robot arm using reinforcement learning techniques such as A2C and PPO. The system will leverage Stable Baselines3 to train machine learning models that can efficiently handle pick-and-place tasks in a simulated environment.

**Objective:**
- **Design the Environment:** Create a virtual environment to simulate real-world conditions for the robot arm.
- **Set Up Logic:** Implement logical rules for robot operation.
- **Train and Test:** Use reinforcement learning algorithms to train and evaluate the robot's performance.
- **Compare Models:** Evaluate different models to find the optimal one.

**Scope:**
- Design the environment using Stable Baselines3.
- Minimum GPU requirements: Nvidia RTX 4GB VRAM.
- Minimum RAM requirement: 16 GB.

**Training Models:**
- Algorithms used: A2C, PPO.
- Models trained with custom MLP and CNN architectures.

**Results:**
The project demonstrated that the A2C model with an MLP policy provided the best results. Further testing with other models and parameter adjustments can enhance performance.
